They don't make light guns that work with LCD screens, so I'm making my own using an Arduino pro micro, a gyroscope, an accelerometer, some geometry and physics math. 

So far it supports firing, secondary firing mode, reload, character leaning (by tilting the gun), and adjustable sensitivity on each axis.

The hardware and coding is complete. Still have a little fine tuning to do, but that'll happen once I install the electronics into the actual gaming gun.

I may add a mini joystick to it as well, so it supports movement and zoom (aiming down sights). I feel like it would be limiting if you have to use a secondary controller/keyboard for movement.
